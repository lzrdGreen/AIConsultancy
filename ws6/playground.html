    <p class="text-xl text-black font-sans p-4">In the realm of AI consultancy, the ability to identify and exploit strategic opportunities goes beyond technological know-how. It requires a sophisticated understanding of business frameworks that have traditionally been used to analyze competitive landscapes, identify opportunities, and build resilient strategies. For experienced business leaders, AI should not be viewed as a standalone technology but as an enabler that enhances core capabilities and sharpens competitive edges. AI consultants use frameworks like SWOT analysis, Porter's Five Forces, and value chain analysis to ensure AI solutions are aligned with the client’s long-term goals and competitive strategies.</p>
