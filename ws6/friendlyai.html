        <h1 style="color: #c51b7d;">Fun AI</h1>
        <div>
            <p>In the bustling heart of London's tech district, a peculiar sound is emanating from behind the glass doors of a sleek office building. It's not the usual cacophony of ringing phones or the rhythmic tapping of keyboards. No, dear readers, it's laughter – genuine, unreserved laughter. Welcome to the brave new world of "Fun AI", where artificial intelligence and human creativity collide in a spectacular display of corporate <span lang="fr">joie de vivre.</span></p>
            <p>Gone are the days when AI was a foreboding spectre looming over the business landscape. Today, it's the life and soul of the party, and AI consultants are the unlikely DJs spinning this digital revelry. Picture, if you will, a group of suited executives huddled around a glowing screen, their faces alight with childlike wonder as they embark on a journey of AI discovery.</p>
            <p>"Tell me a joke about monkeys," one brave soul ventures, his voice tinged with both excitement and trepidation. The AI, ever obliging, responds with a quip so unexpectedly clever that the room erupts in guffaws. It's a scene that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago – seasoned professionals giggling like schoolchildren at the wit of a machine.</p>
            <p>But the fun doesn't stop there. As the ice breaks and inhibitions melt away, the prompts grow bolder. "Write a short story about a young girl and a dino," requests a usually reserved CFO. The AI obliges, weaving a tale so charming and unexpected that even the most hardened cynics find themselves leaning in, captivated.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The <span lang="fr">pièce de résistance</span>, however, comes when someone suggests dabbling in AI-generated imagery. "A dragonfly," says one. "No, no," interjects another, eyes gleaming with mischief. "If music be the food of love, play on. Hyper detailed. Hieronymus Bosch!" The resulting image is a kaleidoscope of colours and imagination, eliciting gasps of awe and peals of laughter in equal measure.</p>

        <div>
            <p>As the session progresses, the boundaries between work and play blur. An impromptu brainstorming session turns into a culinary adventure as the AI suggests recipes based on random ingredients shouted out by the team. Even the most serious topics are approached with a newfound lightness. "I'm feeling really stressed about work lately," admits one participant. The AI's response is surprisingly insightful, prompting a thoughtful discussion on work-life balance that feels more like a chat among friends than a corporate seminar.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The day concludes with a rousing round of AI Trivia, where even the most knowledgeable team members find themselves learning something new. "Canberra is the capital of Australia?" exclaims one disbelieving voice. "I thought it was Sydney!"</p>
            <p>As the sun sets on this extraordinary day of discovery, one thing is clear: AI is no longer just a tool for efficiency and analysis. It's a catalyst for creativity, a bridge between the technical and the human, and most importantly, a source of unbridled joy in the corporate world.</p>
            <p>So, dear readers, the next time you hear uproarious laughter emanating from a boardroom, don't be surprised. It's not a corporate takeover or a hostile merger causing such mirth. It's simply the sound of business professionals discovering the delightful world of Fun AI – one joke, story, and fantastical image at a time.</p>

                <li>Feeling adventurous?

        <h1>Useful AI</h1>
        <div>
            <p>The Q&A session may turn in something much more useful than Trivia if you ask the AI follow up questions. For instance: “Act as a business consultant. I've heard a lot about AI, but how can it actually help my business? I run a small shop selling groceries.” ChatGPT 4o replied: “AI can help improve your grocery shop in several practical ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><em>Inventory Management: </em>AI-powered systems can track sales patterns and predict which products will sell more at specific times. This helps avoid overstocking or running out of popular items.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Customer Insights: </em>AI can analyze customer preferences, allowing you to stock items that your regular customers are more likely to buy. You can also tailor promotions or loyalty programs based on these insights.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Pricing Optimization: </em>AI algorithms can recommend optimal pricing strategies by analyzing competitors, demand, and seasonal trends. This can help you maximize profits while remaining competitive.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Supply Chain Efficiency: </em>AI can suggest the best times to reorder stock or even predict potential disruptions in your supply chain, ensuring you stay ahead of any issues.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Personalized Marketing: </em>AI tools can help create personalized email or SMS campaigns to keep customers engaged, especially for promotions or new products that match their buying history.</p></li>
                <li><p><em>Automation: </em>AI-powered tools can automate repetitive tasks like bookkeeping, invoicing, and scheduling, giving you more time to focus on other business areas.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Implementing AI in small ways can make a significant difference in streamlining your operations and boosting profits.“</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>I am not going to evaluate the commercial worth of the replies but you can keep asking questions about the Supply Chain, Personalized Marketing, Customer Insights, Inventory Management, etc. Or use more traditional methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> or search engines of your choice. Thus AI provides us with an alternative to search, handbooks and manuals and even training courses!</p>
            <p>It also makes sense to take a closer look at the prompt itself: <em>“Act as a business consultant.”</em> - this shows which expertise is required. The LLMs, large language models behind text generating AI, work better when the area of expertise is specified. <em>“How can AI help my business?”</em> - this is what I want to know, my search intent. But there is a third part, the context: <em>“I run a small shop selling groceries.”</em> Can you imagine a search engine or textbook caring about your specific circumstances?</p>
